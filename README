If you're reading this, maybe you were curious about what I had on my profile
here on GitHub, or you were sent a CV from me and you're taking a look at what
I've done over here.

Things I enjoy:

- GNU/Linux and other *nix systems
- Free (and open source) software
- Functional programming (e.g. Haskell)
- Maintaining a pristine Git commit history
- Languages, both programming and human

Feel free to take a look at my activity, and if you want to speak to me, you can
send me a message through the email address publicly displayed on my profile.
